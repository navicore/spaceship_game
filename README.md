TODOs on my own:
===========

* [x] New Assets
* [ ] Game Over
* [ ] Re-implement collision detection with "bevy rapier" plugin (or other
  physics engine plugin)
* [ ] Re-implement collision handling so that things bounce off each other
  unless one is a missile
* [ ] Terrain
* [ ] Terrain generation - maybe with gigs
* [ ] Terrain from streaming domain observations
